# **Introduction**

Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."

Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving problems

With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with its own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI.
